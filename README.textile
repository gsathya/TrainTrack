h1. Train Track 

Train Track is an android app which lists the train schedules for the Chennai MRTS. 

*Note : This app was created for personal use. I have not done extended testing.*

Also this was hacked up in a weekend (under 32 hours to be specific).

h2. Installation
# Download "TrainTrack.apk":https://github.com/downloads/gsathya/TrainTrack/Train%20Track.apk 
# Install it on your android phone
# Move the files in /time directory to your sdcard
# Open the App

h2. Tested
# Nexus One
# HTC Legend

h2. To Do
# Expand list to include the other rail services as well.
# Make a companion app to include all the bus schedules


h2. Note

A point to note, I have used flat files instead of a db file. The reason for that was :
# I was not going to update the time schedule.
# I didn't need any security. (It's for my personal use)
# Creating a db helper class was too much of a hassle.

Also, This schedule includes only one track from _beach_ -> _velachery_ and not vice versa. I will add this shortly.

fn1. Please free to download and use the app. Any comments, constructive or otherwise, would be welcome.
